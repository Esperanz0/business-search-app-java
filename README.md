# Yelp Search

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how I build Android applications from the ground up.
It is less about the application content and more about the code (and processes). 

The goal is to showcases my knowledge of Java object oriented programming in Android, including my knowledge of:

- Reactive programming with [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/2.x) and 
  [RxAndroid 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid/tree/2.x)
- Dependency injection with [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger/tree/dagger-2.10-rc4)
- Testing with [JUnit 4](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/blob/master/doc/ReleaseNotes4.12.md), 
  [Mockito 2](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/tree/release/2.x), 
  [Robolectric 3](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/tree/robolectric-3.3.2), and
  [Espresso](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/index.html)
- [Clean, modular architecture](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture)
- [Model-View-Presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) (MVP) pattern
- [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) (MVVM) pattern
- Networking with [Retrofit 2](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/parent-2.2.0)
- Mapping with [Google Maps APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/)
- Java and Android best practices, including programming patterns/styles
- Creating readable, focused, and well-documented pull requests

## Application and Features

Using the [Yelp Fusion (v3) REST API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3), 
I have created a simple Yelp search application with the following features:

- Display places around the user's current location in a list and map views
- Show more details on a specific place when clicking on a list or map item

I kept the application short and simple with no advanced UI for brevity. I am not using the 
[Yelp Android API](https://github.com/Yelp/yelp-android) so that I am able to demonstrate my knowledge of 
[Retrofit 2](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/parent-2.2.0)
